RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Tutorial

What is RAG?
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. Instead of relying solely on what a language model learned during training, RAG first retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base, then uses that information to generate accurate answers.

Why use RAG?
1. Accuracy: RAG reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in actual documents.
2. Up-to-date information: You can update the knowledge base without retraining the model.
3. Source attribution: You can show users where the information came from.
4. Privacy: Your documents stay on your own system.

How does RAG work?
Step 1: Document Loading - Load your documents (PDFs, text files, etc.)
Step 2: Chunking - Split documents into smaller pieces (chunks)
Step 3: Embedding - Convert chunks into vectors (numbers that represent meaning)
Step 4: Storage - Store vectors in a vector database
Step 5: Retrieval - When a user asks a question, find the most similar chunks
Step 6: Generation - Send the question + relevant chunks to an LLM to generate an answer

Key Components:
- Embeddings: Mathematical representations of text that capture semantic meaning
- Vector Database: A database optimized for storing and searching embeddings
- LLM: The language model that generates the final answer

Common Vector Databases:
- Chroma (simple, good for learning)
- Pinecone (cloud-hosted, scalable)
- Weaviate (open source, feature-rich)
- FAISS (by Facebook, very fast)

Tips for Better RAG:
1. Chunk size matters: Too small = missing context, too large = irrelevant info
2. Overlap helps: Overlapping chunks prevent losing context at boundaries
3. Clean your data: Better input = better output
4. Test different k values: k is the number of chunks retrieved
